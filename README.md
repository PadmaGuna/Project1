For this project, our group analyzed a large dataset of Road Traffice Injuries from the state of California from 2002-2010 published by the California Department of Public Health. The dataset measured traffic collisions by region, mode of transportation, and severity of injuries among many other numerous categories.

Since California is the largest state by population in the United States, it was unsurprising that there are a large number of traffic collisions year over year. Initially, the raw data showed a slight decrease in the number of collisions over the years, however, when adjusted for population there was not a clear trend.

From analyzing the data, the Southern California region has the largest number of severe injuries and deaths to its counterparts by over 200,000 and 80,000 to the next highest region, the Bay Area, respectively. Perhaps this means that Southern California is truly the most dangerous region in California for traffic collisions. Logically, this could be impacted by the fact that is by far the largest region of the fourteen regions, but there would leave more opportunities for such accidents to occur. Even when adjusted for population, Southern California has significantly higher rates of severe injury and death than all of the other regions in the dataset.

When examining collisions by mode of transportation, collisions from cars/pickups and vehicles are significantly higher (66.9%) than collisions from motorcycles, pedestrians, trucks, buses, and bicyclists (33.1% combined). When adjusted for population, the statistics for cars/pickups and vehicles are even worse, climbing to 80.8% of severe injuries and 83.5% of all deaths.

As a state known for its highways and car-centric culture, it's to be expected that the majority of collisions would come from personal vehicles, but since rates increased after adjusting for population, this indicates that at least in California, cars and trucks may be more dangerous than bicycles, motorcycles, buses, and pedestrian transportation.

When looking at severe injury and death rates adjusted for population, death rates increase for car/pickup and pedestrian collisions. Surprisingly, despite the lack of safety features in a motorcycle, death rates decrease for people in motorcycle collisions. It is possible that since they are more aware of the danger of a collision, motorcyclists as a whole tend to be more aware of their surroundings. Being involved in a collision as a pedestrian, however, has the least amount of protection with no vehicle/transportation device to protect the pedestrian in the event of a collision.

Overall, when looking for the safest form of transportation in California, people should consider using the bus when possible. According to the California Department of Health, transportation accidents are the second leading cause of death in California for people under the age of 45.Investing in alternative forms of transportation like buses, bike lanes, and safe sidewalks could lead to a decrease in injuries and death rates.
